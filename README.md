# Bens Books Library WebAPP

This project was completed for The Odin Project JavaScript Library Assignment. 

This is soley created using Vanilla JS. 

The aim of the project was to create a library web app that you could add and delete books aswell as changing the read status. ideally making use of the concepts of Prototypal inheritance and the Constructor function.

This is a complete and fully functionnal Persoanl WebApp Library, where i can manage my own Library (Add, Edit, Delete books). All my data is synced and stored in a database using Google's mobile and web application development platform [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
